Twint
Scraping Twitter with Twint, the official Twitter API is effective in certain respects, but the amount and speed of data collection is fairly restrictive. Twitter's Basic Search API only goes back seven days, while social scientists are also interested in data from months or years ago. The cost of buying historical Twitter data is always out of the control of the average social scientist, and only limited data can be scraped using Twitter API.
	Hence twitter scraping was implemented using Twint. The Twint Python library takes advantage of this so that the Twitter information can be collected without using the API.
Twint was used for scraping the data for 58 hospitals, out of which only 46 hospitals had tweets dated from January 1 to September 30, 2020.
